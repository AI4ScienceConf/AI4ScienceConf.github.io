## Submission & Presentation Tracks

To establish a smooth transition between individual AI and science publications, we have three submission tracks.

* Main Conference Proceeding: formal publications in PMLR.
* Main Journal Proceeding: high-impact publications in [TBA] journal. Submissions from the main conference track may opt into this track.
* Symposium Presentation: please refer to this page.

We consider a broad range of subject areas focused on the intersection of AI and scientific discovery for the first iteration of CAIS. A non-exhaustive list of topics of interests includes:

## Review Process

Recognizing the highly interdisciplinary nature of AI for Science, we are committed to establishing two distinct pools of reviewers: one with a primary focus on AI and the other on scientific disciplines.

<!-- Submissions will be double blind: reviewers and ACs cannot see author names when conducting reviews, and authors cannot see reviewer and AC names. This means that the submission must not contain acknowledgements or any link (e.g., github) that would reveal authors' identity.

We will use OpenReview to manage submissions. The reviews and author responses will not be public initially. Submissions under review will be visible only to their assigned program committee. We will not be soliciting comments from the general public during the reviewing process. Accepted papers and their reviews will be made public after decisions are made. Discussions between reviewers and program committee members and with the authors of accepted papers will be made public. Rejected or withdrawn papers, their discussions and meta data will not be published.

Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the abstract submission deadline. The information entered in the profile is critical for ensuring that conflicts of interest are handled properly.

The program will include oral presentations and posters of accepted papers. Authors can revise their paper as many times as needed up to the paper submission deadline. Changes to the paper will not be allowed while the paper is being reviewed. -->
