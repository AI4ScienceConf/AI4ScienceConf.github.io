We invite high-quality submissions focusing on applying cutting-edge data-driven AI/ML models to scientific discovery problems to the 1st Conference on AI for Science. We are devoted to bridging the publication and review process in both AI and Science communities, see **submission track** and **review process** below.

## Submission Tracks

To establish a smooth transition between individual AI and science publications, we have three submission tracks:

1. **Conference proceeding/non-proceeding track**: major contributed paper submissions for poster and oral presentations.  We review both proceeding and non-proceeding papers following the same review process, with the option for the authors to select non-proceeding mode if the paper is planned to be submitted to other journal proceedings.

2. **Journal proceeding track**: highest-quality and -impact submissions for publications in [TBA] journal. All submissions from the main conference track can opt into this track. The final selection will be made by our steering committee.

Interested in providing a presentation in symposium: Please refer to the  Symposia contributing contents on [Call for Symposia](https://ai4scienceconf.github.io/cfs.html) and Accepted Symposium (TBA) pages for details of contributing talks.


## Submission guideline: 

All submissions must be in a single PDF format including, in this suggested order:

* The submitted paper main content
* Paper references
* [Optional] supplementary content

Supplementary codes, demos etc.

**Paper length**:  For **Conference proceeding/non-proceeding track and Journal proceeding track**, each submission suggests being written within 5000 words or 9 pages in the main text using [CAIS template], including all figures and tables. For all tracks, reasonable Supporting Information/Appendix is allowed.

**Abstract submission**:  
Submitting an abstract first can help the program chairs to make some initial decision on if your submission is suitable for CAIS and allow them to invite the most suitable reviewers for each paper via a “reviewer bid process” based on the abstract.

We consider a broad range of subject areas focused on the intersection of AI and scientific discovery for the first iteration of CAIS. A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:

## Review Process
Recognizing the highly interdisciplinary nature of AI for Science, we are committed to establishing two distinct pools of reviewers and area chairs: one with a primary focus on AI and another with a primary focus on individual scientific fields. Decisions will be made with reviewer-reviewer, reviewer-AC, and AC-AC discussions from both sides.

**Double-blind review**: We will use double-blind review process for all the papers.

**Dual submission policy**: CAIS accepts dual submission to journal, preprint servers, and non-proceeding workshops/symposia, but not submissions have been accepted by or under review process in other conferences.

**Rebuttal process**: TBA
